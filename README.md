This study develops a predictive model for Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the Northern Arabian Sea using satellite-derived data (NFLH, POC, SST) from MODIS Aqua L3 SMI. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine platform and Random Forest Regression (RFR), the model captures nonlinear relationships between variables, achieving an RÂ² of 0.833 and explaining 83.3% of Chl-a variability. Results show higher Chl-a concentrations in coastal areas, driven by nutrient-rich waters from river discharges and upwelling, while offshore regions exhibit lower values due to oligotrophic conditions. NFLH and POC levels align with phytoplankton activity and terrestrial inputs, while SST variations reflect coastal cooling during upwelling. The study highlights the effectiveness of combining remote sensing and machine learning to analyze marine ecosystems, offering insights into phytoplankton dynamics and environmental interactions.
